# Responsive Portfolio

This project was about creating a website to display our portfolio. The website needed to be responsive, meaning that the navbar, images, and icons all needed to resize appropriately for different viewscreens, such as ipad and iphone screens as well as laptop and wide screens.

## Utilization

This portfolio can be used as a way to introduce myself, showcase work I have done during this class, and also as a method for people to contact me. It will be a constantly changing site, but the framework is there for me to continue this project as an ever-evolving introduction to myself as a computer programmer.
